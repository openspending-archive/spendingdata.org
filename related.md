There are several initiatives which standardize data related to the 
specific types that we are looking at. Here's a brief overview:

* The **[World Bank's BOOST](http://wb-boost.org/)** initiative collects fine-grained expenditure data from over 47 countries and has published data for Kenya and [Moldova](http://data.gov.md/raw/107). The data is available in an Excel-based tool and can be analyzed in detail. In the future, the 
project is considering the alignment of some of the classifications between BOOST datasets.
* [IATI](http://aidtransparency.net), the **International Aid Transparency
  Initiative**, is a successful campaign to standardize the form in which
  information about international development projects is reported by 
  donor states, implementing organizations and recipient countries. 
* [XBRL](http://www.xbrl.org/), the **eXtensible Business Reporting
  Language**, is a data container framework in which specific taxonomies
  can be used to report financial information, in particular related 
  to accounting methods such as US GAAP. The emerging specification for
  a [General Ledger](http://www.xbrl.org/GLTaxonomy) taxonomy can also represent more fine-grained, 
  transactional information, but requires its users to understand a 
  complex format. 
* The US Congress is considering the **[DATA Act](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR02146:%7C/home/LegislativeData.php%7C)** which would establish a common format for all US government financial releases. More information is available from the [Data Transparency Coalition](http://datacoalition.org/agenda/data-act.html) and the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/taxonomy/term/data-act/).
* The UK Local Government Association has published a **[Publishing local spending data guide](http://localspending.readandcomment.com/)** that specifies the rules under which UK local councils publish their expenditure raw data.
* The **UK Treasury** has [published guidance documents](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_transparency_index.htm) with instructions to central government bodies regarding the release of fine-grained expenditure data. The specification gives some guidance on the format of the data 
but has proven to be too imprecise in practice.
* The **[Payments Ontology](http://data.gov.uk/resources/payments)** is an attempt to map government expenditure to Linked Data.
