title: Help us to make this standard
---

As we proceed to refine our ideas for an international spending standard, 
we hope to collaborate with a wide range of practicioners, from 
government to civil society, auditors to industry suppliers. 

The idea of a standard format for expenditure data can only work if 
many re-users and data publishers join together to make a specification 
that is easy to implement and useful in practice.
